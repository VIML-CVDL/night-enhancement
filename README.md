### Datasets
1. [Light-effects data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ro8fs629ldebzc2/AAD_W78jDffsJhH-smJr0cNSa?dl=0)

Light-effects data is collected from Flickr and by ourselves, with multiple light colors in various scenes.

2. [LED data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7lhpnj2onb8c3dl/AAC-UF1fvJLxvCG-IuYLQ8T4a?dl=0)

We captured images with dimmer light as the reference images.


3. [GTA5](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gfw44ttcu5czrbg/AACr2GZWvAdwYPV0wgs7s00xa?dl=0)

Synthetic GTA5 nighttime fog data



4. [Syn-light-effects](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2sb9na4ur7ry2gf/AAB1-DNxy4Hq6qPU-afYIKVaa?dl=0)

Synthetic-light-effects data
